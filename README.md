# Coursework

Place to store files for courses I am taking

These projects are all code-along projects for courses from Udemy, Udacity, or other places. While I have hand-typed all of the code in here, I take no credit for coming up with it. Learning platform, instructor last name, and course title will be included in all branch paths.

These projects are form Brad Traversy's React Front to Back 2019 course on Udemy
